## Why I Built Clara

I wanted to create a **safe, actually helpful AI health buddy**-something that’s approachable, privacy-conscious, and genuinely useful. Clara:

- Listens to your concerns  
- Provides friendly suggestions  
- Reminds you to seek professional care when needed

## What Clara Can Do

Here’s how she helps:

- **Symptom guidance:**  
  *Example:* “My head hurts and I feel hot” → Clara suggests rest, hydration, asks follow ups, and reminds you to check your temperature.  

- **Minor injuries:**  
  *Example:* “I think I twisted my ankle” → Clara suggests the RICE method (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) + “See a doctor if swelling persists.”  

- **End of chat summary:**  
  Clara provides a concise recap and asks: “Did I help?”
